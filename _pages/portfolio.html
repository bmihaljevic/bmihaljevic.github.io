State-of-the art algorithms for learning discrete Bayesian network classifiers from data, including a number of those described in Bielza & Larranaga (2014) <doi:10.1145/2576868>, with functions for prediction, model evaluation and inspection.

Roughly X downloads since . Implemented in R and C++. See the Github page for issues and contibution and the paper and vignettes for details.
