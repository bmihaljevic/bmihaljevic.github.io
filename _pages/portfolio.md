## bnclassify: Learning Discrete Bayesian Network Classifiers from Data

State-of-the art algorithms for learning discrete Bayesian network classifiers from data, with functions for prediction, model evaluation and inspection.

The package has been downloaded over 47 thousand times (by March 2022) from the RStudio mirror of the Comprehensive R Archive Network [(CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bnclassify/index.html), with roughly a thousand downloads per package update.

Implemented in R and C++. See the Github [page](https://github.com/bmihaljevic/bnclassify) for issues and contibuting and the [paper](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-073/index.html) and [vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bnclassify/vignettes/overview.pdf) for details.
