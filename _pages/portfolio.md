## bnclassify: Learning Discrete Bayesian Network Classifiers from Data

State-of-the art algorithms for learning discrete Bayesian network classifiers from data, including a number of those described in Bielza & Larranaga (2014) <doi:10.1145/2576868>, with functions for prediction, model evaluation and inspection.

The package has been downloaded over 21 thousand times (in September 2019) from the RStudio mirror of the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), with roughly a thousand downloads per package update.

Implemented in R and C++. See the Github [page](https://github.com/bmihaljevic/bnclassify) for issues and contibution and the [paper](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-073/index.html) and vignettes for details.
